K SOFT SEQuencer
----------------

ksoftseq is a software sequencer for OS/2.

ksoftseq enables you to play a midi file on OS/2 without any external programs.

That is, ksoftseq is a MCD(Media Control Driver).

ksoftseq can:

  * play a midi file by clicking a icon on WPS
  * play a midi file with play.cmd in a command line
  * play a midi file with Player in Open menu
  * play a midi file with MIDI Editor in Open menu
  * play a midi file with MIDI program(MIDI editor) in Multimedia folder.
    Although MIDI may complain like 'An error occurred while opening ...',
    you can use features provided by MIDI without any problem if you press
    'ESC' key or click 'Continue' button.
  * play a HMMIO handle of a midi file opened with MMIO_NOTRANSLATE,
    MMIO_TRANSLATEHEADER or MMIO_TRANSLATEDATA
  * seek
  * ...

ksoftseq cannot:

  * play MCI_OPEN_PLAYLIST
  * ...

Installation
------------

1. Unzip ksoftseq zip file into any directory

2. CD into the directory

3. Execute 'minstall.exe' in the directory.

4. Follow the instruction of 'minstall'.exe

4. After installing, copy your own SoundFont2 file to KSOFTSEQ.SF2 in
   X:\\MMOS2, where X is a boot drive

5. Or you can specify the qualified path of your own SoundFont2 with
   KSOFTSEQ_SF2 environmental variable in CONFIG.SYS like:

     SET KSOFTSEQ_SF2=C:\path\to\your\soundfont2\file.sf2

   ksoftseq will try to find the SoundFont2 file pointed by KSOFTSEQ_SF2.
   If KSOFTSEQ_SF2 is not set or the file does not exist, then try to use
   KSOFTSEQ.SF2 in X:\MMOMS2, where X is your boot drive.

6. Add 'SET KAI_AUTOMODE=DART' to CONFIG.SYS. Without this, your system may
   become unstable because Uniaud APIs are not supported well nowadays.

7. Reboot
